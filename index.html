            Preparedness is a key to food safety during a flood. If you expect a
            flood, keep an adequate supply of food, water and emergency
            equipment on hand. This includes enough canned food to last four to
            five days, a hand can opener, battery-powered radio, extra batteries
            and emergency cooking equipment like a camp stove with fuel to
            operate it.

            might lose everything they have: their homes, their jobs, even their
            loved ones. Whether it’s donating money or volunteering to rebuild
            damaged houses, there are a several ways to lend a helping hand to
            those in need.

            Many of the areas hardest hit by the floods were already struggling
            before the water swallowed their homes. A large proportion of the
            counties affected were already experiencing extreme levels of
            malnutrition. With the water swept away the little they have and
            made an already very difficult situation even worse.
